## Tower Defense game created as part of Qualification project

Game implements a customizability feature through modular rings, that modify towers' behaviour.
Currently, rings can modify tower stats (range, fire rate), projectile stats (damage, speed, pierce, add buffs, etc.), change which projectile the tower uses and modify the order of operation when reading tower stats.

This is a prototype for the game.
